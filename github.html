            <p id="intro">Introduction to C</p><hr>
            <p class="para-content">C is a powerful, low-level programming language that has been the backbone of modern computing for decades. Known for its efficiency and control over system resources, it remains a favorite for operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, mastering C opens doors to deeper programming insights.</p>

            <p class="para-content">In this blog, we'll cover the following:

            <div id="preprocessor">
                <p class="headings">1. Types of pre-processor directives</p>
                <p class="para-content">Preprocessor directives in C are commands that begin with # and are processed before compilation. They handle tasks like including files (#include), defining macros (#define), and conditional compilation (#ifdef, #ifndef). These directives help in code modularity, reusability, and conditional compilation, making programs more flexible and efficient.</p>
                <p class="example">Example:</p>
                <img src="image/PreprocessorDirectories.png" alt="preprocessor" class="image-content">

                <p class="example">Output:</p>

            </div>

            <div id="tokens">
                <p class="headings">2. Tokens in C</p>
                <p class="para-content">Tokens in C are the smallest elements of a program that hold meaning for the compiler. They include keywords (reserved words like int, return, while), identifiers (names assigned to variables, functions, and arrays), constants (fixed values like 10, 3.14, 'A'), strings (sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes, e.g., "Hello"), special symbols ({}, [], ;, #, etc.), and operators (+, -, *, /, ==, &&). These tokens form the fundamental building blocks of a C program, defining its syntax and structure.
                </p>
                <p class="example">Example:</p>
                <img src="image/tokens.png" alt="preprocessor" class="image-content">

                <p class="example">Output:</p>

            <div id="formattedIO">
                <p class="headings">3. Formatted I/O Functions</p>
                <p class="para-content">Formatted I/O functions in C allow structured input and output using format specifiers. The most commonly used functions are printf(), which displays formatted output, and scanf(), which reads formatted input. printf() uses format specifiers like %d for integers, %f for floating-point numbers, and %s for strings, allowing precise data representation (e.g., printf("Value: %d", num);). Similarly, scanf() reads user input based on specified formats, ensuring correct data interpretation (e.g., scanf("%d", &num);). These functions play a crucial role in handling user interaction efficiently in C programs.
                </p>
                <p class="example">Example:</p>
                <img src="image/formattedio.png" alt="preprocessor" class="image-content">

                <p class="example">Output:</p>
                <img src="output-img/Formattedi-o.PNG" alt="preprocessor" class="image-content">
            </div>


            <div id="unformattedIO">
                <p class="headings">4. Unformatted I/O Functions</p>
                <p class="para-content">Unformatted I/O functions in C handle input and output without format specifiers, working with characters or strings directly. Functions like getchar() and putchar() are used for single-character input and output, while gets() and puts() handle strings. For example, getchar() reads a single character from the user, and putchar() prints a character to the screen. Similarly, gets() reads an entire line of text, and puts() displays a string followed by a newline. These functions provide a simple way to handle basic I/O operations in C.
                </p>

                <img src="image/putsgets.png" alt="preprocessor" class="image-content">

                <p class="example">Output:</p>

            <div id="controlflow">
                <p class="headings">5. Control Flow </p>
                <p class="para-content">Control flow in C determines the execution order of statements in a program. The switch-case statement is used for multi-way branching, where a variable is compared against multiple case values, executing the matching block (e.g., switch(choice) { case 1: printf("One"); break; }). It is useful when handling multiple conditions efficiently. The goto statement allows jumping to a labeled part of the code (goto label;), which can sometimes simplify loops or error handling but is generally discouraged due to reduced readability and maintainability. Both provide ways to control program execution based on conditions.

                <img src="image/switchcasegoto.png" alt="preprocessor" class="image-content">

                <p class="example">Output:</p>

            <div id="arrays">
                <p class="headings">6. Arrays </p>
                <p class="para-content">In C, an array is a collection of variables of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. You can think of it as a way to group multiple variables under a single name, and you access each element using an index. Arrays are useful for storing and manipulating large sets of data efficiently, like a list of numbers or characters. They provide a simple and powerful way to work with data structures in C.
                </p>
                <p class="example">Example:</p>
                <img src="image/arrayandtypes.png" alt="preprocessor" class="image-content">

                <p class="example">Output:</p>

            <div id="arrayoperations">
                <p class="headings">7. Array Operations </p>
                <p class="para-content">In C, arrays provide a powerful way to handle multiple elements of the same type, and with the use of loops and built-in functions, you can perform various operations on them. C allows you to easily add arrays element-wise, where corresponding elements from two arrays are summed up and stored in a third array. Sorting is also straightforward in C, with various algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort, allowing you to arrange the elements of an array in ascending or descending order. These operations, such as addition and sorting, are fundamental for handling large datasets and performing mathematical computations or organizing data efficiently in C.

                <img src="image/operationsArray.png" alt="preprocessor" class="image-content">

                <p class="example">Output:</p>

            <div id="transpose">
                <p class="headings">8. Transpose of an Array </p>
                <p class="para-content">C also allows us to perform operations like transposing a matrix using loops, which is a crucial skill for 11th-grade exams. Transposing involves swapping rows and columns of a matrix, which can be efficiently done by iterating through the matrix elements with nested loops. This ability to manipulate arrays and matrices in C is important for solving problems in areas like algebra, physics, and computer science, where matrix operations are frequently required. By using loops and understanding array indexing, students can easily perform tasks such as matrix transposition, addition, and sorting, which are essential for their exams.

            <div id="patterns">
                <p class="headings">9. Patterns </p>
                <p class="para-content">In C, creating patterns is a common practice for students to improve their understanding of loops, conditionals, and array manipulation. Patterns often involve using nested loops (for rows and columns) to print specific sequences of characters or numbers, and this is a vital skill for your 11th-grade exams.
                </p>
                <p class="example">Example:</p>

            <div id="stringhandling">
                <p class="headings">10. String Handling Functions </p>
                <p class="para-content">In C, string handling is done using a set of functions provided in the <string.h> library. These functions allow for efficient manipulation of character arrays, which are used to represent strings in C. Key functions include strlen(), which calculates the length of a string; strcpy(), used to copy one string into another; strcat(), which concatenates two strings; strcmp(), for comparing two strings lexicographically; strchr(), to find the first occurrence of a character in a string; and strstr(), which searches for a substring within a string. Mastering these string functions is crucial for handling text-based data and is often tested in 11th-grade exams, making them essential for effective programming in C.
